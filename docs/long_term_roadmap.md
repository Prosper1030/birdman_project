# Birdman Project Technical Requirements Documentation

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive technical requirements document outlines the algorithmic foundations and implementation strategies for the Birdman Project, a sophisticated project management system designed for academic environments with variable team availability and overlapping skills. The system integrates advanced Resource Availability Cost Problem (RACP) algorithms, enhanced Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) approaches, flexible resource modeling, academic calendar integration, and AI-readable documentation standards to create a robust platform for managing student team projects.

**Core Innovation**: The Birdman Project addresses the unique challenges of academic project management by combining multi-group membership capabilities in resource allocation with flexible scheduling models that accommodate the dynamic nature of student availability and skill development.

## 1. RACP Algorithm Design and Implementation

### Mathematical Foundation and Core Requirements

The **Resource Availability Cost Problem (RACP)** forms the backbone of minimum staffing calculations in the Birdman Project. The system must implement a hybrid optimization approach that minimizes total resource costs while satisfying project deadlines and multi-group membership constraints.

**Primary Algorithm Architecture:**
- **Modified Minimum Bounding Algorithm (MMBA)** for exact solutions on smaller project instances (≤30 activities)
- **Hybrid metaheuristic approach** combining Particle Swarm Optimization with Scatter Search for larger instances
- **Constraint Programming models** using lazy clause generation for optimal solutions on benchmark problems

### Multi-Group Membership Implementation

The system requires sophisticated handling of resources that belong to multiple skill groups simultaneously. **Key implementation requirements:**

**Resource Capability Matrix Design:**
```
Resource[i] = {
    skill_groups: [group_ids],
    proficiency_levels: {group_id: level},
    switch_costs: {from_group: {to_group: cost}},
    availability_windows: [time_slots]
}
```

**Hierarchical Skills Framework:** Resources possess different skill levels within each group, with activities requiring minimum skill thresholds. The system must implement **skill-level constraints** in mixed-integer linear programming formulations, allowing dynamic resource assignment based on current project needs and skill development over time.

**Multi-Group Assignment Optimization:** Forward Activity List (FAL) schemes must handle resources switching between groups with associated transition costs and time penalties. The **Quality Transmission Mechanisms** should integrate dynamic rework subnet reconstruction when multi-group resources change assignments.

### Computational Complexity and Scalability

Given RACP's **strongly NP-hard complexity**, the system must implement tiered algorithmic approaches:
- **Instances ≤30 activities**: Exact methods (MILP or CP solvers)
- **Medium instances (30-100 activities)**: Hybrid metaheuristics 
- **Large instances (100+ activities)**: Pure metaheuristics with local search optimization

**Performance targets**: Sub-second response times for resource availability queries, with optimization runs completing within 10 minutes for complex multi-project scenarios.

## 2. Enhanced RCPSP for Student Teams

### Flexible Resource Profile Implementation

The **RCPSP with Flexible Resource Profiles (FRCPSP)** adaptation addresses the unique scheduling challenges of student teams. Unlike traditional fixed-resource models, this system accommodates **variable weekly and daily hour commitments**.

**Time Granularity Architecture:**
```python
class StudentAvailability:
    weekly_hours: int  # Total weekly commitment
    daily_slots: Dict[Day, List[TimeSlot]]  # Specific availability windows
    skill_development: Dict[Skill, LearningCurve]  # Dynamic capability growth
    commitment_factor: Dict[TimeWindow, float]  # Variable productivity levels
```

### Multi-Skilled Resource Constraints

The system implements **Multi-Skilled RCPSP (MSRCPSP)** extensions where students possess heterogeneous skill sets that evolve during project execution. **Critical requirements:**

**Dynamic Skill Modeling:**
- **Time-dependent skill levels**: `SkillLevel[student][skill][time] = BaseSkill + LearningRate × time`
- **Skill breadth and depth tracking** with efficiency multipliers for different competency levels
- **Cross-training optimization** considering skill transfer coefficients between related domains

**Flexible Scheduling Constraints:**
- **Hybrid time models** combining weekly hour pools with daily availability windows
- **Academic calendar integration** handling exam periods, holidays, and varying course loads
- **Commitment level variations** with productivity factors based on external obligations

### Solution Algorithms for Academic Contexts

**Priority-Based Heuristics:** Fast, practical solutions suitable for dynamic student environments:
- Earliest Start Time with academic deadline priorities
- Skill-based rules considering required competencies and student expertise
- Resource availability prioritization accounting for class schedules

**Constraint Programming Approach:** Global constraints for complex academic requirements:
- Interval variables for activity scheduling with flexible duration allocation
- Academic calendar propagators for semester-based constraints
- Resource capacity constraints with skill-level requirements

## 3. Advanced Resource Modeling Architecture

### Task Type Classification and Data Structures

The Birdman Project must support three distinct resource allocation paradigms, each requiring specialized data structures and algorithms.

### Resource Dependency Modeling

**Advanced Dependency Management:**
- **Implicit dependency inference** from resource attribute usage patterns

- **Cascade failure prediction** through directed dependency graphs

**Performance Optimization Strategies:**
- **Centralized strategic planning** with distributed operational execution showing 40% utilization improvements
- **Machine learning integration** achieving 47% reduction in resource blocking rates
- **Context-aware skill matching** providing 5-10% utilization increases through dynamic competency tracking

## 4. Academic Calendar Integration Architecture

### Technical Standards and API Integration

The calendar integration subsystem must handle the complex, multi-layered nature of academic scheduling while providing real-time synchronization and conflict resolution.

**Core Protocol Implementation:**
- **CalDAV (RFC 4791)** as the primary calendar protocol with XML-based operations
- **Google Calendar API** integration supporting OAuth 2.0, push notifications, and batch operations
- **Microsoft Graph Calendar API** for Microsoft 365 ecosystem integration
- **iCalendar (RFC 5545)** standard for cross-platform calendar data exchange

### Academic-Specific Calendar Modeling

**Hierarchical Data Structure:**
```
Academic Year
├── Semesters/Terms

│   ├── Exam Periods (override constraints)
│   ├── Assignment Deadlines (project milestones)
│   └── Campus Events (resource conflicts)
└── Academic Calendar Exceptions (holidays, breaks)
```

**Complex Recurrence Handling:**
- **Multi-level time blocking** for course sessions, office hours, and exam periods
- **Exception management** for holiday breaks interrupting regular schedules
- **Resource constraint integration** considering classroom capacity, equipment, and travel time

### Conflict Resolution and Synchronization

**Advanced Conflict Detection:**

- **Multi-factor analysis** including time overlap, resource availability, attendee validation, and capacity constraints
- **Priority-based resolution** using academic hierarchy (core classes > electives > optional events)

**Real-Time Synchronization Architecture:**
- **Webhook-based push notifications** for immediate calendar updates
- **Sync token implementation** for efficient incremental synchronization
- **Multi-source federation** handling Google, Outlook, institutional, and personal calendars simultaneously

## 5. AI-Readable Technical Documentation Standards
