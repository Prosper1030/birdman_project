# Birdman Project Technical Requirements Documentation

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive technical requirements document outlines the algorithmic foundations and implementation strategies for the Birdman Project, a sophisticated project management system designed for academic environments with variable team availability and overlapping skills. The system integrates advanced Resource Availability Cost Problem (RACP) algorithms, enhanced Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) approaches, flexible resource modeling, academic calendar integration, and AI-readable documentation standards to create a robust platform for managing student team projects.

**Core Innovation**: The Birdman Project addresses the unique challenges of academic project management by combining multi-group membership capabilities in resource allocation with flexible scheduling models that accommodate the dynamic nature of student availability and skill development.

## 1. RACP Algorithm Design and Implementation

### Mathematical Foundation and Core Requirements

The **Resource Availability Cost Problem (RACP)** forms the backbone of minimum staffing calculations in the Birdman Project. The system must implement a hybrid optimization approach that minimizes total resource costs while satisfying project deadlines and multi-group membership constraints.

**Primary Algorithm Architecture:**
- **Modified Minimum Bounding Algorithm (MMBA)** for exact solutions on smaller project instances (≤30 activities)
- **Hybrid metaheuristic approach** combining Particle Swarm Optimization with Scatter Search for larger instances
- **Constraint Programming models** using lazy clause generation for optimal solutions on benchmark problems

### Multi-Group Membership Implementation

The system requires sophisticated handling of resources that belong to multiple skill groups simultaneously. **Key implementation requirements:**

**Resource Capability Matrix Design:**
```
Resource[i] = {
    skill_groups: [group_ids],
    proficiency_levels: {group_id: level},
    switch_costs: {from_group: {to_group: cost}},
    availability_windows: [time_slots]
}
```

**Hierarchical Skills Framework:** Resources possess different skill levels within each group, with activities requiring minimum skill thresholds. The system must implement **skill-level constraints** in mixed-integer linear programming formulations, allowing dynamic resource assignment based on current project needs and skill development over time.

**Multi-Group Assignment Optimization:** Forward Activity List (FAL) schemes must handle resources switching between groups with associated transition costs and time penalties. The **Quality Transmission Mechanisms** should integrate dynamic rework subnet reconstruction when multi-group resources change assignments.

### Computational Complexity and Scalability

Given RACP's **strongly NP-hard complexity**, the system must implement tiered algorithmic approaches:
- **Instances ≤30 activities**: Exact methods (MILP or CP solvers)
- **Medium instances (30-100 activities)**: Hybrid metaheuristics 
- **Large instances (100+ activities)**: Pure metaheuristics with local search optimization

**Performance targets**: Sub-second response times for resource availability queries, with optimization runs completing within 10 minutes for complex multi-project scenarios.

## 2. Enhanced RCPSP for Student Teams

### Flexible Resource Profile Implementation

The **RCPSP with Flexible Resource Profiles (FRCPSP)** adaptation addresses the unique scheduling challenges of student teams. Unlike traditional fixed-resource models, this system accommodates **variable weekly and daily hour commitments**.

**Time Granularity Architecture:**
```python
class StudentAvailability:
    weekly_hours: int  # Total weekly commitment
    daily_slots: Dict[Day, List[TimeSlot]]  # Specific availability windows
    skill_development: Dict[Skill, LearningCurve]  # Dynamic capability growth
    commitment_factor: Dict[TimeWindow, float]  # Variable productivity levels
```

### Multi-Skilled Resource Constraints

The system implements **Multi-Skilled RCPSP (MSRCPSP)** extensions where students possess heterogeneous skill sets that evolve during project execution. **Critical requirements:**

**Dynamic Skill Modeling:**
- **Time-dependent skill levels**: `SkillLevel[student][skill][time] = BaseSkill + LearningRate × time`
- **Skill breadth and depth tracking** with efficiency multipliers for different competency levels
- **Cross-training optimization** considering skill transfer coefficients between related domains

**Flexible Scheduling Constraints:**
- **Hybrid time models** combining weekly hour pools with daily availability windows
- **Academic calendar integration** handling exam periods, holidays, and varying course loads
- **Commitment level variations** with productivity factors based on external obligations

### Solution Algorithms for Academic Contexts

**Priority-Based Heuristics:** Fast, practical solutions suitable for dynamic student environments:
- Earliest Start Time with academic deadline priorities
- Skill-based rules considering required competencies and student expertise
- Resource availability prioritization accounting for class schedules

**Constraint Programming Approach:** Global constraints for complex academic requirements:
- Interval variables for activity scheduling with flexible duration allocation
- Academic calendar propagators for semester-based constraints
- Resource capacity constraints with skill-level requirements

## 3. Advanced Resource Modeling Architecture

- **Context-aware skill matching** providing 5-10% utilization increases through dynamic competency tracking

## 4. Academic Calendar Integration Architecture

### Technical Standards and API Integration

The calendar integration subsystem must handle the complex, multi-layered nature of academic scheduling while providing real-time synchronization and conflict resolution.

**Core Protocol Implementation:**
- **CalDAV (RFC 4791)** as the primary calendar protocol with XML-based operations

## 7. Model Context Protocol (MCP) 整合與 AI 協作框架升級

### 7.1 MCP 核心概念

Model Context Protocol (MCP) 是一個專為大型語言模型 (LLM) 與外部數據源、工具互動而設計的開放標準協議。其核心目標是提供一個統一且高效的方式，讓 AI 系統能動態發現並利用外部資源。

**主要特點：**
* **LLM 專用協議**：相較於通用的 API，MCP 更專注於 LLM 的互動模式。
* **動態發現 (Dynamic Discovery)**：允許 AI 在執行階段動態查詢伺服器可用的工具和數據，具備高度靈活性。
* **開放標準**：作為一個開放協議，有利於建立一個跨模型、跨平台的 AI 工具生態系。

### 7.2 MCP 為 Birdman 專案帶來的優勢

將 MCP 引入本專案，與我們在 `AGENTS.md` 和 `PROJECT_INTENT.md` 中建立的 AI 協作理念高度契合，預期將帶來以下優勢：

* **強化 AI Agent 自動化**：目前的 AI 協作依賴於讀取 Markdown 文件。未來透過 MCP，AI Agent 將能直接呼叫專案後端服務（如觸發 CPM 分析、執行 RACP 資源反推），實現更高層次的自動化與自主決策。
* **提升決策支援能力**：MCP 能讓 AI 更輕易地存取即時外部數據。例如，AI 可自動查詢最新的材料科學數據庫來輔助結構設計、獲取即時天氣資訊來評估飛行測試風險，或分析供應商報價來優化採購策略。
* **簡化未來 API 開發**：在規劃 RESTful API 的階段，可直接評估採用 MCP 作為核心協議，從而簡化 AI 與後端微服務的整合，降低開發複雜度。

### 7.3 未來整合方向

MCP 將作為本專案**第三開發階段**的關鍵技術引入。

* **API 協議評估**：在開發後端微服務時，將 MCP 作為 RESTful API 的替代或補充方案進行評估與 PoC (概念驗證)。
* **工具化核心演算法**：將專案中的核心演算法（如 `cpm_processor`, `rcpsp_solver`）封裝成可由 MCP 動態發現和呼叫的「工具」。
* **建立自主分析流程**：最終目標是讓 AI Agent 能夠基於專案目標，自主規劃並執行一系列的分析工具組合（例如：先執行 WBS 合併 -> 再跑 CPM -> 最後根據結果提出風險報告），完成複雜的專案管理任務。
